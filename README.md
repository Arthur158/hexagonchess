# Hexagon Chess
A simple hexagon chess game implemented in JavaScript, with a server and a client. This project was part of a course at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/).

Hexagonal chess is a chess variant played on a hexagonal board. The game was invented by Władysław Gliński in 1936. The game is played on a hexagonal board comprising 91 hexagonal cells. Each player has 23 pieces: 1 king, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 2 pawns, and 14 hexagonal pawns. The game is played with the same rules as standard chess, with some exceptions. See the [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_chess) for more information.
